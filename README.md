## Overview

Made by : [FarelW](https://github.com/FarelW)
Deployment : [Link](https://user-fw-laravel-auth-o5lw9ighs-eeksapi.vercel.app/)

Here is the purpose of making this project :
- To fullfil the submission from TalentGrowth technical test submission
- To make animations to enhance user experience on specific elements of a webpage
- To create a responsive form website layout that adjusts seamlessly across various devices
- To create the next screen to show all of the form data
- To create restful API

## Built With

- [xammp for php](https://www.apachefriends.org/)
- [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)


## Explanation of Features
- `Responsive`: When designing a layout to ensure consistency and usability across various screen sizes, I prioritize a mobile-first approach combined with responsive design techniques. This involves starting with the smallest screen size, such as smartphones, and then progressively enhancing the layout for larger screens using media queries. I utilize relative units like percentages and viewport widths to ensure elements adapt fluidly to different screen sizes. Tailwind CSS's utility classes, especially those prefixed with lg: for larger screens, provide a convenient way to apply responsive design without writing custom CSS.
- `Show data` : After the form submitted, it will directly navigate to page where the formdata that has been filled are shown.
- `Git control system` : I am using git version control system in maintaining my project.
- `Deployment` : I am using vercel free hosting platform, to let other user experience my website easily.
- `Restful API` : I create a restful api that contains Crate, Read, Update, and Delete function throughout many endpoints

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need to perform several installations, including:
- `NodeJs` : Node.js is essential for running JavaScript on the server-side and for managing JavaScript-based build processes, including those used in React applications.
- `npm` (Node package manager) : npm is indeed the package manager for JavaScript and is used to install and manage JavaScript packages and libraries, including those required for React development.
- `php` : popular general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to web development. It is used for server-side scripting to develop dynamic web pages and applications.
- `composer` : dependency manager for PHP, similar to npm for Node.js. It is used to manage and install PHP packages and libraries that your project depends on.
